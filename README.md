cf, only update the map when player changes of room ?

+ hold m button to show the map in big ??

bug to fix : fix diagonal movement : https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0cYjreg7dpg


cf player if player.position is egual to self.rect.x/.y-.w*0.5/-.h*0.5 ???

ideas to implement : subroom/areas (9 areas in 1 room) , doors/gaps in walls not always at the center , 
store room.number as an array of char/bool ?




what to do for middle vision : if the player is between 2 rooms,
show like the player is 1 room [the implemented version]
show like the player is in the 2 rooms (need to modify how the player position is stored)
?
